\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Over the course of the last decades, many cellular \acp{abm} have been proposed and implemented
[CITATIONS].
Their puposes range from early embryogenesis to cancer research over to scar healing [CITATIONS].
Some of these models provide exact mathematical formulations [CITATIONS] of the system which they
solve.
Although it is well-known that \acp{abm} and \acp{ca} are a subclass of (continous or discrete)
dynamical systems [CITATIONS], there has not yet been a directed effort towards a unifying
mathamtical formalism for \acp{abm}.
We aim to provide insights into a variety of shared concepts along specific examples with real
use-cases.
We construct this formalism along the implementation of our numerical simulation framework
\lstinline{cellular_raza} [CITATION].

\acp{abm} are centered around the thought that cells are the fundamental building-blocks of nature.
Every cellular agent is distinct to any other and can in principle be tracked throughout space and
time.
Individual-based behaviour gives rise to global phenomena such as pattern-formation [CITTAIONS].
The cells are part of the physical domain and may interact with it in various ways eg. via Exchange
of Ligands, Diffusion or physical forces.
Furthermore, cells interact with each other directly.
Most of these interactions are of short range compared to the total size of the system although
counter-examples such as electrical signals exist [CITATIONS].
We explicitly note that our assumptions are not fundamental and lossening of these restrictions can
be discussed to possibly cover a wider variety of problems.
It is important to consider these limitations when applying this theoretical framework.

\section{The Cellular Space $\mathscr{C}$}
We assume that each individual cell lives in a space $C$ which describes all possible configurations
of this single cell.
Cellular systems are characterized by the fact that cells are in principle (although in
practice sometimes more difficult) tracable through time and space.
Depending on the cellular representation we might encounter two cells with identical parameters and
properties (eg. position, intracellular concentrations) which are still distinct agents and can not
be interchanged arbitrarily.
This case could occur eg. when representing cellular positions by whole numbers as in a
\ac{ca}.
This point is further made clear when thinking about cellular proliferation as a tree.
Figure~\ref{fig:cell-lineage-break} shows a hypothetical change between two child-cells.
If we would interchange child $c_{12}$ with $c_{21}$, this would mean that two grandchild-cells
$gc_{212}$ and $gc_{221}$ would have different grandparent-cells.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.5cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm}]
      \node {$p_1$}
        child {node {$c_{11}$}
          child {node {$gc_{111}$}}
          child {node {$gc_{112}$}}
        }
        child {node (c12) {$c_{12}$}
        child {node {$gc_{121}$}}
          child {node {$gc_{122}$}}
        };
        \node[] at (6, 0) {$p_2$}
        child {node (c21) {$c_{21}$}
          child {node {$gc_{211}$}}
          child {node {$gc_{212}$}}
        }
        child {node {$c_{22}$}
        child {node {$gc_{221}$}}
          child {node {$gc_{222}$}}
        };
        \draw[dashed,<->] (c12) -- (c21);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{
        Arbitrary cells can not be interchanged freely since this might introduce incorrect
        configurations into the cell-lineage.
        For example, the two cousin-cells $gc_{212}$ and $gc_{221}$ would have different
        grandparent-cells if $c_{12}$ and $c_{21}$ would be interchanged.
    }
    \label{fig:cell-lineage-break}
\end{figure}

This exemplifies the need to assign unique identifiers for cells to correctly trace their lineage.
We call the set of all identifiers $J$ and only consider cells as a combination of an element
$c\in C$ with an identifier $j\in J$.
Thus a cell is an element of the product $J\times C$.
The explicit representation of $J$ can depend on the respective system in question.

\begin{definition}[Cellular State]
    Let $J$ be a set of identifiers and $C$ be the set describing cellular agents.
    We call a set of cells $M\in Pot(J\times C)$ a cellular state if $M$ is finite and every cell
    has a unique identifer ie. $\#\pi_1(M)=\#M$.
\end{definition}

To allow for processes such as cell-division and death we additionally must be able to treat a
variable number of cells throughout the evolution of the dynamical system.

\begin{definition}[Cellular Space]
    The cellular space $\mathscr{C}(J, C)$ of an index set $J$ and cellular configuration space $C$
    is given by $\mathscr{C}(J,C) = \{M\in Pot(J\times C) | M \text{ is cellular state }\}$.
    We may choose the simplified notation $\mathscr{C} = \mathscr{C}(J, C)$ where the context is
    clear.
\end{definition}

The evolution function of our dynamical system will map cellular states onto each other, thus
acting on the cellular space $\mathscr{C}$.

Furthermore, as can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:cell-lineage-break}, division of cells introduces
two new identifiers with two new cells and consumes the previously existing cell.
Cell-death removes cells but newly created ones may not obtain their unique identifier making it
also unique in time.
It is clear that by these processes identifiers $j\in J$ live in a connected subset $U\subset T$
where $T$ is the monoid of our dynamical system describing time.

When we compare these statements with \acp{ca} such as the Game of Life~\ref{example:game-of-life},
we immediately see that this cellular identity is not preserved.

\section{Dynamical Systems}
\begin{definition}[Dynamical System]
    A dynamical system is a tuple $(T,M,\phi)$ where $T$ is a monoid (written additively) and
    $\phi$ is a mapping
    \begin{equation}
        \phi : U\subset(T\times M) \rightarrow M
    \end{equation}
    with $\pi_2(U) = M$ where $\pi_2$ is the projection on the second coordinate and $\phi$
    satisfies
    \begin{align}
        \phi(0,m) &= m\\
        \phi(t_2, \phi(t_1, m)) &= \phi(t_2+t_1,m).
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
We often write $\phi(t,m) = \phi_t(m)$.
Classical \acp{ca} such as Conway's Game of Life \cite{Graner1992} or the Cellular Potts Model
\cite{games1970fantastic} are spatially and temporally discrete dynamical systems.
In the case of \acp{abm} the space $M$ consists of the collection of all currently living cells
$\mathscr{C}$ and the physical domain $D$ in which they live ie. $M=\mathscr{C}\times D$.

\begin{example}[Game of Life]
    \label{example:game-of-life}
    Conway's Game of Life is perhaps the most popular example for a cellular automaton.
    It is deterministic and functions on a infinite grid $\mathbb{Z}^2$ by assigning one of two
    states (alive or dead) to each grid-point
    \begin{equation}
        L:\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}
    \end{equation}
    where we prefer the short-hand notation $L(i,j)=L_{ij}$ or $L^n_{ij}$ where $n$ is the temporal
    index.
    This means a single state is described by a mapping $L:\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ and the
    evolution function of this dynamical system acts on the space of these maps
    $X:=\{L:\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow\{0,1\}\}$
    \begin{equation}
        \phi:U\subset(\mathbb{N}\times X) \rightarrow X
    \end{equation}
    where we identified $(\mathbb{N},+)$ as the monoid of the dynamical system.
    Let $\eta_{ij}\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ be the set of spatial indices which are direct neighbors of
    $(i,j)$ ie. $\eta_{ij}=\{(k,l)\in\mathbb{Z}^2 \text{ where } |k-i|<2, |l-j|<2 \text{ and }
    (k,l)\neq(i,j)\}$.
    The game consists of three rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
        \item Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
        \item Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
        \item Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
            reproduction.
    \end{enumerate}
    Together with the sum of all neighboring cells $S_{ij}=\sum\limits_{\iota\in\eta_{ij}}L^n_\iota$
    we can write these as
    \begin{equation}
        \phi(L_{ij}^n) = L_{ij}^{n+1} =
        \begin{cases}
            0 &L^n_{ij}=1 \text{ and } S_{ij}<2\\
            1 &L^n_{ij}=1 \text{ and } S_{ij}=2,3\\
            0 &L^n_{ij}=1 \text{ and } S_{ij}>3\\
            1 &L^n_{ij}=0 \text{ and } S_{ij}=3\\
            0 &\text{else}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
\end{example}

\section{Dynamics}

\section{Spatial Decomposition}
We assume that the physical domain $D$ can be split into smaller subdomains
$\bigcup_{i\in I}S_i=D$ which are pairwise disjoint.
We will later require that any dynamics can be calculated by considering cellular agents inside a
given subdomain $S_i$ and their interactions with neighboring subdomains.
This also applies to spatial effects such as diffusion.
Therefore, we must first develop the notion of being a \textbf{neighbor} which can be defined by
two equivalent methods.

\begin{definition}[Neighbor]
\hspace{0cm}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We call $\eta:I\rightarrow Pot(I)$ a \textbf{neighbor map} if
            $i\in\eta(j) \Leftrightarrow j\in\eta(i)$ for each $i,j\in I$.
        \item We call a relation $||$ on $I$ a \textbf{neighbor relation} if it is symmetric.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Note that in the numerical implementation it is often more convenient to work with the first
definition while the second can be more useful in a theoretical context.

\begin{proof}
    $1) \Rightarrow 2)$ Let $\eta$ be a neighbor map.
    We define a relation $||$ by $i||j \Leftrightarrow i\in\eta(j)$.
    It is clear that $||$ is symmetric.\\
    $2) \Rightarrow 1)$ Let $||$ be a symmetric relation on $I$.
    We define the function $\eta:I\rightarrow Pot(I)$ via
    $\eta(i):=\{j\in I \text{ such that } i||j\}$.
    If $j\in\eta(i)$ then $i||j \Leftrightarrow j||i$ and thus $i\in\eta(j)$.
\end{proof}

Equipped with this notion of \textbf{neighbor}, we can now formalize the spatial splitting of our
domain.

\begin{definition}[Spatial Decomposition]
    A Spatial Decomposition of a domain $D$ is a collection of subsets
    $\{S_i\subset D: i\in I\}$ together with a either a neighbor map $\eta$ or neighbor relation
    $||$ such that $D=\cup_{i\in I}$ and $S_i$ are pairwise disjoint.
\end{definition}

\section{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}
In the previous section, we have determined aspects of cellular systems which we aim to describe
with suitable abstractions.
As we have already shown, these aspects can be grouped into 3 categories.
The first category only considers a single cell by itself while the second and third consider
interactions with other cells and the external environment respectively.
Lastly, we allow an external controller to make changes to the experimental setup in accordance with
the experimental reality.

\subsection{Intracellular Representations and Processes}
\label{subsec:abstractions-cell}
\subsubsection{Mechanics - Spatial Representation, Intracellular Forces \& Movement}
\label{subsubsec:abstractions-cell-mechanics}
\subsubsection{Intracellular Reactions}
\label{subsubsec:abstractions-cell-reactions}
\subsubsection{Cycle}
\label{subsubsec:abstractions-cell-cycle}

\subsection{Cell-Cell Interactions}
\label{subsec:abstractions-cell-cell}
\subsubsection{Forces}
\label{subsec:abstractions-cell-cell-forces}
Forces acting between cells are often described in terms of interaction potentials $V(x_i, x_j)$
where $x_i,x_j$ are the position of two cells.
\begin{equation}
    F_i = \nabla_{x_i}V(x_i, x_j)
\end{equation}
If $V$ only depends on the difference between the two positions $x_i-x_j$, we obtain an
antisymmetric expression in $i,j$.
\begin{align}
    F_i &= \nabla_{x_i}V(x_i-x_j)\\
    &= -\nabla_{x_j}V(x_i-x_j)
\end{align}
However, this assumption is only valid for point-like objects without any additional structure.
Consider the example where a cell is represented by two points $(p_1, p_2)$ which are connected with
a spring of length $l$ and strength $D$.
This may be a simplified model for an elongated bacteria.
We can write down the force contribution from intracellular forces
\begin{align}
    F_{\text{intra},i} = \begin{bmatrix}
        - D (|p_1-p_2|-l)\\
        D (|p_1-p_2|-l)
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
We can assume that the two vertices of one cell $p_{1,i},p_{2,j}$ are interacting with both vertices
of the other.
This reslts in a force term of the form
\begin{align}
    F_{\text{extra},i} &= \begin{bmatrix}
        F(p_{1,i}, p_{1,j}) + F(p_{1,i}, p_{2,j})\\
        F(p_{2,i}, p_{1,j}) + F(p_{2,i}, p_{2,j})
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    F_{\text{extra},j} &= \begin{bmatrix}
        F(p_{1,j}, p_{1,i}) + F(p_{1,j}, p_{2,i})\\
        F(p_{2,j}, p_{1,i}) + F(p_{2,j}, p_{2,i})
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
and thus we can clearly see that $F_{\text{extra},i}\neq - F_{\text{extra},j}$ even if
$F(a,b)=-F(b,a)$.
This means that we have to rely on a method which calculates both the forces acting on cell $i$ and
$j$ simultanously.
To be able to model friction forces (although rare) we additionally take the velocity $v_i$ into
account.
Further, we allow additional information $\sigma_i$ to be exchanged between the cells during their
interaction (ie. species specific).
We take this as the basis for calculating forces between cells.
\begin{equation}
    (F_i, F_j) = F(x_i, x_j, v_i, v_j, \sigma_i, \sigma_j)
\end{equation}
