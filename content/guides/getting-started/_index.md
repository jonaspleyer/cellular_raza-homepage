The guides in this section are designed to provide insights into different
[cellular aspects](/internals/concepts/cell), [domain aspects](/internals/concepts/domain) and to
teach how to construct simulations bottom-up.
They are fully working examples of simulations executed with `cellular_raza`.

However, we also provide [templates](/guides/templates) which can be used as starting points for the
development of new simulations.
