Growth patterns of bacteria have been observed ...

## Mathematical Description
### Mechanics & Interaction

We represent cells as soft spheres with the interaction potential as in the
[cell-sorting](/showcase/cell-sorting) example but omitting the species-specificity.

### Reactions

### Cycle

## Parameters & Initial State
