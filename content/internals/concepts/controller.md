title: âš™ Controller

An external controller is able to remove and modify cells at will.
This special simulation [aspect](/internals/concepts) is contrary to the philosophy behind local
interactions but resembles an external observer such as an experimentalist.
This aspect can also be used to prematurely abort simulations when a given criterion is reached.
A controller is however not all-knowing and restriced to modifications on the cellular level.
It can not change the internal behaviour of the extracellular domain.

<!-- TODO finish desribing the controller in more detail -->
