This backend was the first one implemented initially and is in the process of being phased out.
It has a monolithic design and requires solving for each [aspect](..) at the same
time.
To obtain greater modularity and flexibility, the [chili](../chili) was designed.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This backend is being phased out at the moment and will not receive further updates in the near
future.
Please consider using the [chili](/internals/backend/chili) backend instead.
