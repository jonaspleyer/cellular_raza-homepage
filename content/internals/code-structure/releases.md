## cellular_raza 0.1.2
[_26th October 2024_](git_diff-0.1.2-incremental.diff)

- Bugfix for assigning correct
  [`CellIdentifier`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/struct.CellIdentifier.html) for parent
  cell

## cellular_raza 0.1.1
[_18th Oktober 2024_](git_diff-0.1.1-incremental.diff)

- adapt some tests and plotting of them
- cleanup module structure for time and some tests
- More detailed descriptions of [concepts](/internals/concepts)
- New formulation of [MorsePotential](/docs/cellular_raza_building_blocks/struct.MorsePotential.html)
- Corrected bugs in the [Langevin](/docs/cellular_raza_building_blocks/struct.Langevin.html)
  mechanics model
- Abstract [Bacterial Rods](/showcase/bacterial-rods) example into building blocks
- Start new subproject [cr_mech_coli](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cr_mech_coli) to build
  mechanistic, mechanical _E.Coli_ model
- changed how identifiers will be updated after division:
  both cells will now receive new identifiers, in the future we want to extend this to arbitrary
  numbers in order to support multiple fission
- removed unused `cellular_raza-building_blocks::prelude`

## cellular_raza 0.1.0
[_28th August 2024 ðŸŽ‰ 2 Year Anniversary ðŸŽ‰_](git_diff-0.1.0-incremental.diff)
- changed calculation of random contribution in `Mechanics` trait
    - Improved stochastic motion testing for Brownian and Langevin dynamics
- Derive macros now support tuple structs
- Implemented extracellular [reactions](/internals/concepts/domain/reactions)
    - First example: bacterial branching
- Add rayon as parallelization scheme
- Improved error handling
    - properly wind down simulation after encountering error
    - first experimentation with error handlers
- rename some trait functions and variables from `neighbour` to `neighbor`

## cellular_raza 0.0.13
[_30th July 2024_](git_diff-0.0.13-incremental.diff)
- Write advanced tests for contact reactions and solvers
- Added Ron storage option
- Restructured and simplified storage solutions
- Improve (but also change parameters) CLI for benchmarks
- use new `circ_buffer` crate in chili backend
- bugfixes for contact reactions
- move homepage to separate repository
- new function to create timestepper `from_partial_save_freq`

## cellular_raza 0.0.12
[_13th July 2024_](git_diff-0.0.12-incremental.diff)
- Implement concepts for contact reactions
- add option to enable/disable determinism

## cellular_raza 0.0.11
[_18th June 2024_](git_diff-0.0.11-incremental.diff)
- corretly treat interaction functions related to neighbours
  [`is_neighbour`](/docs/cellular_raza_concepts/trait.Interaction.html#method.is_neighbour) and
  [`react_to_neighbours`](/docs/cellular_raza_concepts/trait.Interaction.html#method.react_to_neighbours)
  in the [chili](/internals/backends/chili) backend.
- modifications to examples

## cellular_raza 0.0.10
[_11th June 2024_](git_diff-0.0.10-incremental.diff)
- change [Interaction](/internals/concepts/cell/interaction) concept to return two force values for
  own and other cell.
- fix some bugs in [chili](/internals/backends/chili) backend (mainly related to
  [Cycle](/internals/concepts/cell/cycle) concept)
- migrate some examples from old `cpu_os_threads` to new [chili](/internals/backends/chili) backend
- change [VertexDerivedInteraction](/docs/cellular_raza_building_blocks/struct.VertexDerivedInteraction.html)
  to use closest point on external polygon

[_1st June 2024_](git_diff-0.0.9-incremental.diff)
- major improvements to the [chili](/internals/backends/chili) backend
    - stabilize main routines and macros

- added more examples
{{< callout type="info" >}}
From now on releases will become more frequent and for smaller feature additions such that version
0.1.0 can be reached sooner.
