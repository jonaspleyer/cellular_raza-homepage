### cellular_raza 0.1.4
[_9th  November 2024_](git_diff-0.1.4-incremental.diff)

- Add testing for `windows-latest`, `macos-12` and `macos-13`
- Publish [`uniquevec`](https://crates.io/crates/uniquevec) crate from code developed in `storage`
  module of `cellular_raza_core` and use as dependency.
- Extend [`UpdateMechanics`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/trait.UpdateMechanics.html) and
  [`UpdateReactions`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/trait.UpdateReactions.html) traits
  to not rely on [`num::Zero`](https://docs.rs/num/latest/num/trait.Zero.html) trait
- Extend [`run_simulation`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/macro.run_simulation.html)
  macros and derivatives with new keywords
    - Specify names of [`AuxStorage`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/) and
      [`Communicator`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili)
    - Specify orders of solvers (for [Mechanics](/internals/concepts/cell/mechanics) and
      [Reactions](/internals/concepts/cell/reactions)
    - Set zero-values for [Force](/internals/concepts/cell/mechanics) and
      [Intracellular](/internals/concepts/cell/reactions) (useful for dynamically-sized structs
      which do not support the [num::Zero](https://docs.rs/num/latest/num/trait.Zero.html) trait.

### cellular_raza 0.1.3
[_26th October 2024_](git_diff-0.1.3-incremental.diff)

- Bugfix for assigning correct
  [`CellIdentifier`](/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/struct.CellIdentifier.html) for parent
  cell
- Version `0.1.2` was yanked due to incorrect bugfix attempt

### cellular_raza 0.1.1
[_18th October 2024_](git_diff-0.1.1-incremental.diff)

  mechanics model
- Abstract [Bacterial Rods](/showcase/bacterial-rods) example into building blocks
- Start new subproject [cr_mech_coli](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cr_mech_coli) to build
  mechanistic, mechanical _E.Coli_ model
- Changed how identifiers will be updated after division:
  both cells will now receive new identifiers, in the future we want to extend this to arbitrary
  numbers in order to support multiple fission
- Removed unused `cellular_raza-building_blocks::prelude`

### cellular_raza 0.1.0
[_28th August 2024 ðŸŽ‰ 2 Year Anniversary ðŸŽ‰_](git_diff-0.1.0-incremental.diff)
- Changed calculation of random contribution in `Mechanics` trait
    - Improved stochastic motion testing for Brownian and Langevin dynamics
- Derive macros now support tuple structs
- Implemented extracellular [reactions](/internals/concepts/domain/reactions)
    - First example: bacterial branching
- Add rayon as parallelization scheme
- Improved error handling
    - properly wind down simulation after encountering error
    - First experimentation with error handlers
- Rename some trait functions and variables from `neighbour` to `neighbor`
